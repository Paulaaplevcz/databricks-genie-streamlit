## Summary

Recently, we had the challenge of creating an application using **Streamlit Apps on Databricks**, integrating it with **Genie**, the conversational BI assistant from Databricks.

We worked as a duo to structure the app and connect it to Genie using the Databricks SDK and the conversational API.  
For the integration logic with Genie, we referenced part of the implementation from the excellent work by [@datasciencemonkey](https://github.com/datasciencemonkey) in his [agents-on-databricks](https://github.com/datasciencemonkey/agents-on-databricks/tree/main) project.

This repository documents our experience and learnings — not as a full tutorial, but as a shared journey that may support others facing similar steps.
