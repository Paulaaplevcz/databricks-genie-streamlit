## Summary

Recently, we had the challenge of creating an application using **Streamlit Apps on Databricks**, integrating it with **Genie**, the conversational BI assistant from Databricks.

We used an existing GitHub project as a starting point and worked as a duo to understand the architecture, setup, and integration flows.  
This repository documents our approach and what we learned — not as a tutorial, but as a shared experience that may help others on a similar path.
